    "history": "Maharaja Bharadwaj The sacrifice of the entire caste is immortal! That was for the country! He was the first in the caste to make countless sacrifices in the defense of the country. Finding the orderly history of the emperors of the entire caste is a very painful task! Even when the history of an emperor is found anywhere, there is no history of its progeny. So the sequence of Vanshwali seems to be broken! Maharaja Bharadwaj of Bharshiva dynasty was the ruler of Awadh. It is very difficult to determine the reign of Maharaja Bharadwaj"
